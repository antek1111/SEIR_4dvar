# SEIR epidemic model with 4d var data assimilation


To start simply run `docker build . -t isz/seir_4dvar` to build docker image, followed by `docker-compose up` in the repository root directory.  

If for some reason you want to run this without docker, all dependencies can be installed with   `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
